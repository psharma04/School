  <h2>What is the ISC?</h2>
  <p>The ISC is a simple hashing algorithm by @MaXiTOR994 and @RBXII3. It was designed to be lightweight, have less than 250 lines of code and stand up to a basic bruteforce script, as well as a reverse-engineered decoder.<br>
    The ISC accomplished all of these requirements. Before minifying, the file was only 143 lines long, and took up a mere 7KB. It ran smoothly on everything from a MacBook Pro to a Raspberry Pi, and the bruteforce test script took over a month to crack a 4 digit code.</p>
  <h4>If you want to know more about the background of this project, click <a href="https://school.rbxii3.tk/LAP-SDL/Presentation.html">here</a>.</h4>
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>The ISC is entirely made in Python 2, and is heavily based on prime numbers and pseudo-random number generators.</p>
  <h4>NOTE: Throughout this page, we will work through the code responses as the user sees them. Therefore, we need to have sample inputs as well.</h4>
  <ul style="text-indent: 3%; font-size:120%">
      <li>Unencrypted data: Hello123</li>
      <li>Password: n4men0tfound</li>
      <li>Seed: CSEC4472</li>
      <img id="toTop" src="scrollup.png" onclick="abcd()" title="Go To Top" width=2%>
  </ul>
  <h2>There are 4 steps:</h2>
  <p>First, the user inputs some data to encrypt. They are then prompted for a password and seed. Note how the program does not display the password, but still captures the input.</p>
  <br><img src="Screenshots/2.png" alt="The user has entered data, a password (which is automatically hidden), and a seed." width="75%"><br>
  <p>Then, the script uses this seed to generate a large number.</p><br>
  <img src="Screenshots/3.png" alt="The confirmation sequence, which is just a face for the traslation of words to decimal in the background." width="75%"><br>
  <p>After that, the password and unencrypted data are translated into numbers, and the seed, password, data and 11 prime numbers are all multiplied together.</p><br>
  <img src="Screenshots/4.png" alt="The script prints a set of large numbers, and then generates another number based on files 2 directories up." width="75%"><br>
  <p>Finally, the hash is outputted for the user, the script opens up this website, and automatically exits.</p><br>
  <img src="Screenshots/5.png" alt="Finally, the ISC hash is outputted." width="75%">
  <br><br>
  <p>This algorithm is extremely simple. However, it is not very efficient. MD5, a well known, widely used hashing algorithm, when coded in Python, is only 6.11KB. Another algorithm, SHA-512, is even smaller, at only 4.52KB. This shows the difference between 2 months and 10 years of algorithm development. SHA-512 is much more secure than ISC, and even the now-outdated MD5 is more secure and more efficient. </p>
  <p>That's not to say it can't be improved, though. You can check out the source code at <a href="https://github.com/psharma04/SDL-Cryptography-Algorithm" alt="my repository on GitHub dot com">https://github.com/psharma04/SDL-Cryptography-Algorithm</a>. Who knows, maybe an implementation of ISC might someday become as popular as MD5 and SHA!</p>
