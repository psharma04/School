  <h2>What is the ISC?</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 110%">The ISC is a simple hashing algorithm by @MaXiTOR994 and @RBXII3. It was designed to be lightweight, have less than 250 lines of code and stand up to a basic bruteforce script, as well as a reverse-engineered decoder.<br>
    The ISC accomplished all of these requirements. Before minifying, the file was only 143 lines long, and took up a mere 7KB. It ran smoothly on everything from a MacBook Pro to a Raspberry Pi, and the bruteforce test script took over a month to crack a 4 digit code.</p>
